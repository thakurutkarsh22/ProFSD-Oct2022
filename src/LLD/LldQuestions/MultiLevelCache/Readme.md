L1 -> l2 -> l3 <br />
each layer will store key value pair of data.


each layer has its own read latency and write latency.

For any operation we need to do the perticular operation and we can find the total time take for the cache to do that operation.

<br />

we can keep stats also of all the last 10 reads and 10 writes.
and we can keep how much that cache level is filled up.
